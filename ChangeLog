Version 0.97.2:

	* The GPC source code is now distributed with LTFAT. A popup
	dialog has been added to mulaclab to explan the license
	conditions.

	* The algorithm for computing dgtreal with a FIR window is now
          implemented in C.

Version 0.97.1:

	* Support for Octave on Windows XP.

	* It is now possible to specify various targets and commands in
	ltfatmex.

Version 0.97

	* Toolbox is now built upon a standalone C library.

	* The 'mulaclab' is a graphical user interface for
          manipulating the spectrogram of a signal. The gui works only
          in Matlab.

	* All functions in the LTFAT C library are now available in
          both single and double precision

	* Compilation and interfaces for both Matlab and Octave
          interfaces now works on Windows XP.

 	* It is now possible to supply a window described by a text
          string or a cell array to all relevant functions. See the
          help on gabwin or wilwin for a description of the
          possibilities.

	* Much better support for optional arguments in functions, and
          for setting default at startup. See the function
          ltfatsetdefaults, ltfatgetdefaults and ltfatarghelper

        * GABRIESZBOUNDS: compute Gabor Riesz bounds for a Gabor Riesz
            sequence.

	* WIL2RECT and RECT2WIL: arrange Wilson coefficients in a
          rectangular shape (with holes) at the correct position in
          the TF-plane.

        * PEVEN and PODD extracts the even and odd part of a signal.

Version 0.96 12/1 2009 svn no 728
	* Matlab MEX compilation now works under Windows. See the
	instructions in the INSTALL file.

	* Speed optimizations in the C-code used by DGT, DWILT and MDCT
	and their inverses.

	* New functions DGTREAL and IDGTREAL works with the positive
	frequencies of the DGT of real valued signals.

	* New functions FFTREAL computes only the positive frequencies of
	the FFT of a real valued input signal.

	* More systematic naming of functions:
		CANDUAL -> GABDUAL
		CANTIGHT -> GABTIGHT
		MIXDUAL -> GAMIXDUAL
		PROJDUAL -> GABPROJDUAL
		GFBOUNDS -> GABFRAMEBOUNDS and GABRIESZBOUNDS
		TF_ADAPTLASSO -> GABELITISTLASSO
		TF_GROUPLASSO -> GABGROUPLASSO

	* Reassignment is a method for sharpening the spectrogram. Support
	for reassignment is included in the new function REASSIGN and an
	easy to use plot RESGRAM.

	* Easy to use plot for plotting instantantaneous frequency:
	INSTFREQPLOT

	* Three different methos for computing instantaneous time and
	frequency: INSTTFDGT, INSTTFPHASE and INSTTFABS.

	* General speedup of many of the SPREAD* routines based on speedup
	in COL2DIAG and more efficient algorithms for sparse matrices.

	* COL2DIAG provides the basic coordinate change needed for
	efficient implementation of spreading function methods. COL2DIAG
	has a C-implementation.

	* New function WIL2RECT converts Wilson coefficients from the
	standard compact layout to a more loose layout, where the
	coefficients are appropriatly placed on the TF-plane. The
	rectangular format is welll suited for visualizing Wilson
	coefficients.

	* The functionality of GFBOUNDS was split into two methods
	computing either frame bounds or Riesz basis bounds

	* Dynamic range in SGRAM and RESGRAM is now specified by the
	'dynrange' parameter instead of previously 'range'.

	* greasylong and doppler signals added.

	* Periodic Heaviside function added, PHEAVISIDE.

	* Simple exponential wave added as EXPMODE.

Version 0.95 6/3 2008 svn no. 595

	* DCT based resampling function.

Version 0.94 24/10 2007 svn no. 556

	* Numerically stable computation of Hermite functions. Thanks to
	Thomasz Hrycak.

	* gabmulappr (approximation of an operator by a Gabor multiplier)
	now works with fast algorithm.

	* group lasso shrinkage and adaptive lasso shrinkage added with an
	example (examp_audioshrink)

	* Removed all support of lattices in the spreading operator
	routines, as this is not practically usefull.

	* Special support in candual for windows shorter than the number
	of channels.

	* The configure style system has been removed. Use ltfatmex instead.

	* phaseplot now uses the phaselocked dgt by default.

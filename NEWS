Version 1.4.2
Version 1.4.2 17/9 2013
* The filterbanks algorithms are now much faster because all the algorithms have been implemented in the C backend
  
* franalasso can now use the the FISTA algorithm

* A generalization of the Goertzel algorithm "gga" has been added". 

Version 1.4.1

* Major change in the output format from the wfilt_ functions

* Experimental filter backend added to handle filters defined on the
  frequency side.

* Bugs fixed for mex interfaces compilation on Mac

---------- LTFAT 1.4 ------------------------------------------

The major feature of the 1.4 series is that the backend now also works
in single precision. Work on the wavelet toolbox is still ongoing.

---------- LTFAT 1.3 ------------------------------------------

This is a development release. It is fully backwards compatible with
the LTFAT version 1.0 and 1.2 series and contain bugfixes, but the
contents of the "wavelets" subdirectory is in development, and the
interfaces described herein may change during the 1.3 development
cycle.

---------- LTFAT 1.2 ------------------------------------------

Version 1.2 is backwards comptatible with the 1.0 series, but
introduces the "frames" framework, which is an object-oriented
interface to the various frames in LTFAT. It does not actually use the
object oriented features in Octave / Matlab, instead it uses a simple
struct to keep track of things.

-------- LTFAT 1.0 ---------------------------

The Linear Time-Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT) is a free software
toolbox (GPLv3) written in the Matlab/Octave scripting language. It
comprises more than 200 different functions in the area of Fourier
analysis, signal processing and time-frequency analysis.

The toolbox can be downloaded from http://ltfat.sourceforge.net.

The toolbox can be used for both educational, research and
computational purposes. It has a backend implemented in C, which can
be compiled to speed up all computational intensive functions.

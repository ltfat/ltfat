-------- LTFAT 2.0 ---------------------------------------------

Main features of LTFAT 2.0 are the wavelets module, the frames 
framework and the real-time block processing framework.

Actual news:

* Added dual-tree complex wavelet transform, general dual-tree wavelet 
  filterbanks and $M$-band transforms.

* Blockproc. framework now supports any sampling rate from interval 4-96kHz
  trough on-the-fly resampling in the background. 

* Fixed compilation issue with gcc 4.7.

* Warning is shown if portaudio is not found during package installation.

* Warning is shown if JRE is run in a headless mode during package loading.


Version 1.4.5

* Added franabp - solving a basis pursuit problem 
                  argmin ||c||_1 s.t. Fc = f 
                  for an arbitrary frame 

* Wavelet routines correctly included in the frames framework.

* Added blockwrite method for a blockwise storage of audio data to a wav 
  file.

* New demos: demo_blockproc_effects, demo_filterbanks, demo_wavelets, 
      demo_wfbt, demo_bpframemul, demo_phaseret

Version 1.4.4

* New routines for calculating Gabor dual widows using convex optimization

Version 1.4.3

* Added chirped Z-transform

* Block processing demos now work in Octave (on Linux)

* New zoomig features for blockplot

Version 1.4.2

* The filterbanks algorithms are now much faster because all the algorithms have been implemented in the C backend
  
* franalasso can now use the FISTA algorithm

* A generalization of the Goertzel algorithm "gga" has been added". 

Version 1.4.1

* Major change in the output format from the wfilt_ functions

* Experimental filter backend added to handle filters defined on the
  frequency side.

* Bugs fixed for mex interfaces compilation on Mac

---------- LTFAT 1.4 ------------------------------------------

The major feature of the 1.4 series is that the backend now also works
in single precision. Work on the wavelet toolbox is still ongoing.

---------- LTFAT 1.3 ------------------------------------------

This is a development release. It is fully backwards compatible with
the LTFAT version 1.0 and 1.2 series and contain bugfixes, but the
contents of the "wavelets" subdirectory is in development, and the
interfaces described herein may change during the 1.3 development
cycle.

---------- LTFAT 1.2 ------------------------------------------

Version 1.2 is backwards comptatible with the 1.0 series, but
introduces the "frames" framework, which is an object-oriented
interface to the various frames in LTFAT. It does not actually use the
object oriented features in Octave / Matlab, instead it uses a simple
struct to keep track of things.

-------- LTFAT 1.0 ---------------------------

The Linear Time-Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT) is a free software
toolbox (GPLv3) written in the Matlab/Octave scripting language. It
comprises more than 200 different functions in the area of Fourier
analysis, signal processing and time-frequency analysis.

The toolbox can be downloaded from http://ltfat.sourceforge.net.

The toolbox can be used for both educational, research and
computational purposes. It has a backend implemented in C, which can
be compiled to speed up all computational intensive functions.

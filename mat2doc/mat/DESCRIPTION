Title: The Large Time-Frequency Analysis Toolbox
Description: The Large Time/Frequency Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT) is a
 Matlab/Octave toolbox for working with time-frequency analysis,
 wavelets and signal processing. It is intended both as an educational
 and a computational tool. The toolbox provides a large number of
 linear transforms including Gabor and wavelet transforms along with
 routines for constructing windows (filter prototypes) and routines
 for manipulating coefficients.
